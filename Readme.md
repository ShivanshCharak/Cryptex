###  User Flow



1. **Browser → API (`/api/v1/order`)**:



   * A client sends a buy/sell order.

   * Example:



     ```json

     {

       "kind": "buy",

       "type": "limit",

       "price": 12000,

       "quantity": 20,

       "market": "sol/usdc"

     }

     ```



2. **API → Redis Queue**:



   * The API pushes the order into a Redis Queue using a key like `MESSAGES`.



3. **Engine (Matching Engine)**:



   * Subscribes to Redis Queue.

   * Pops the order using the `MESSAGES` key.

   * Processes the order and publishes the result (fills, executed quantity) using Redis Pub/Sub to the respective `clientId`.



4. **API → Redis Pub/Sub**:



   * API subscribes to Redis Pub/Sub using `clientId`.

   * Receives real-time updates for order execution (`ORDER_PLACED`, `fills`, etc.) and returns this data to the browser.



5. **WebSocket**:



   * The browser maintains a WebSocket connection for real-time updates.

   * The WebSocket service streams back order status, ticker, trade fills, etc.

### Engine Internals



* **Market Streams on Init**:



  * On startup, the engine listens to Redis streams like:



    * `Trades@SOL/USD`

    * `DEPTH@SOL/USD`

    * `Ticker@SOL/USD`



* **Redis Pub/Sub**:



  * Used to distribute updates across API and WebSocket components.



* **Redis Queue**:



  * Handles order queuing for the engine to consume and process.



---



###  Price Data Aggregation



* **Engine → DB Processor**:



  * Pushes raw trade data (`Price`, `Volume`, `Timestamp`) into Redis Lists.



* **DB Processor → Timeseries DB**:



  * Aggregates raw trades into candlestick data (OHLC - Open, High, Low, Close).

  * Stores structured historical data for charting and analytics.



---



### Real-Time Pub/Sub Summary



* Subscribed clients are notified through Redis channels using their `clientId`.

* All Redis messages are structured and pushed through:



  * `Redis Queue` → for backend processing.

  * `Redis Pub/Sub` → for client notifications.
